Hello {employee_name}, 

Welcome to Reliant Solutions! This email will cover the basics of setting up the following services: 
1) Active Directory Credentials 
2) Intermedia Email 
3) Intermedia Phone 

Active Directory Credentials

login: {user_name}
Temporary Password: {temp_pwd}

Your Active Directory Credentials give you access to the following services:
1) Internal WiFi 
2) Company VPN 
3) Access to Jump1 servers

If you are in the office, change your password here: https://auth.reliantsec.net/
After changing your password, log in with your new password to verify the change worked: https://auth.reliantsec.net/
If you are not in the office, connect to the VPN first before changing your password.  
Instructions to use the VPN may be found on our wiki.  You'll need to authenticate to the portal first:
https://portal.reliant.io/
Once authenticated access the wiki link:
https://wiki.reliant.io/doku.php/services/accessing_reliant?s[]=remote
To download and test the VPN client:
 -  Use this link if inside the office at TLH or in Brazil (not nyc): https://remote.reliantsec.net/ 
 -  Use this link if outside the office: https://108.27.36.18/global-protect/login.esp
 -  If you are in NYC, tether from your phone or use non-office Internet and go to: https://108.27.36.18/global-protect/login.esp
Do not forget to change your password from the temp password that was sent!
Last thing: Your pw will expire in 90 days and our system does not currently offer a reminder.  Please set a reminder in your phone to reoccur every 84ish days so your account does not get locked and you will require someone to assist you.
